    <p style="text-decoration:none; background-color: #000000; color:#9b42f5; font-size: 30px; class="p-welcome"> Asteroids of the Vortex is based on my love for science fiction, classic arcade games, and history. The purpose of this game is to remind us that history repeats itself. As the player goes through time, asteroids and aliens from the time vortex try and infiltrate Earth. The point of the game is to gain as many points as possible by defeating aliens and asteroids before time runs out. The asteroids and aliens symbolize the different hardships that hit humanity through time. Designed as a single-player game, it takes one person to overcome the asteroids illustrating how a single act can help humanity in ways unimaginable. The game is coded in JavaScript with p5.js and the p5.play library. It is placed on the web with Github. HTML and CSS are used to enhance the overall design. There are six screens. There is a title screen, an instructions screen, two game worlds, a score screen, and finally a game over screen. The overall aesthetics and assets of the game were inspired by classic science fiction arcade games to evoke nostalgia. The user experience and controls use mainly keyboard interactions with “s” to move screens, arrow keys to move the ship, “x” to shoot, and“r” to travel through time. Every time an asteroid or alien has been defeated a score of one point is added. Every time the player time travels a score of two is added to the final score. There is also a timer that once runs out directly takes the player to the game over screen. The player can also restart the time vortex at any point of the game with a button input. There are three more button inputs on the HTML with links to game resources, the game repository, and this artist statement.
